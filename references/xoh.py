Toward the central position, the fractional abundance of OH
is estimated to be 1×10−7. This is a typical fractional abundance of OH reported for diffuse and translucent clouds 
(Wiesemeyer et al. 2012; Weselak et al. 2010; Felenbok & Roueff 1996), and is consistent with chemical models (e.g. Le Petit etal. 2004).
The OH 18 cm line can be used to trace a new class of warm molecular gas surroun ding a molecular cloud, which is not well traced by emission of CO and its isotopologues.

Similarly OH, whose abundance relative to  H2 was found by Crutcher (1979) to be constant over a wide range
of  extinction ===> Intro Listz & lucas 2002 (https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2002/32/aa2499.pdf)

- CO, which is also removed by photodissociation, shows a more modest increase because its formation is tied to the OH abundance.

The transition to CO appears to be more stable, with all five clouds requiring about 1.5×1021cm−2(orAV~0.7) to efficiently shield CO against photodissociation in the local ISRF. 
The transition cannot be attributed to the sensitivity threshold of the CO survey. It is consistent with the AV 0.5 transition noted for the
formation of the OH molecule that is one of the precursors of
CO in the chemical evolution (Barriault et al. 2010).

 CO-dark H2dominates the molecular columns up to AV~0.9 and its mass often exceeds the one-third of the molecular mass expected by theory.

 Dust,  however,  is  not  perfect  either.  For  extinction-based
measures, variations in the compositional and size distribution
of grains can effect the reddening law. And, for emission-based
measures,  variations  in  grain  temperature  along  the  line  of
sight are impossible to correct for and so impose unavoidable
uncertainty (Schnee et al.
2006
).
In the study of Persues star-forming regions, Goodman2009 claimed that dust seems to trace the "full" mass distribution better than molecular lines over the range of \av=1$-$12 amg
