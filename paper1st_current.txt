\begin{abstract}
Many studies have proved the existence of the ``dark interstellar medium'' (dark ISM) which is not detected by traditional radio emission from atomic hydrogen (\hi) and carbon monoxide (CO) molecules. To probe this gas component, interstellar dust has been used as a proxy for total gas column density \NH. By comparing the thermal dust data from Planck satellite (Release 1.2) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey %(Schlafly et al. 2011) 
with archival \hi\ and OH data from the Arecibo Millennium survey, %(Heiles \& Troland 2003) 
we confirm the tight linear correlations between optical depth \t353, dust radiance \rad, reddening \ebv\ and the total proton column density \NH. By using the accurately-measured \NHI\ from the Millennium survey as the total gas column density (along sightlines where neither CO nor OH is detected) to estimate our own dust opacity \s353=\t353/\NH\ and dust specific luminosity \LH=4$\pi$\rad/\NH, we conclude that the variation of \s353 reported by Planck Collaboration (2014) is due to the evolution of dust grains in the ISM and the change in their \LH\ may come from the presence of the dark gas.
%In recent years, Hydroxyl (OH) has emerged as a powerful indicator of dark-ISM. In this study, we use \hi and OH data from the Arecibo Millennium survey (Heiles \& Troland 2003) which observed absorption and emission pairs towards 79 extragalatic radio continuum sources. The $\Lambda$-doubling transitions of ground-state OH at 1665.402 and 1667.359 MHz were observed along with \hi towards 48 of the 79 survey positions. By newly reducing this unpublished data using channel-by-channel method, OH absorption was detected in 23 sightlines, we find that the OH 1665 and 1667 lines satisfy the optically thin assumption with the optical depth $\tau$ less than 0.25 and they are in general not in Local Thermal Equilibrium. (These results are consistent with DiLi et al. (2017) who used the same OH dataset?).
%\sout{\color{red}[JO NOTE: Rearranged and commented out some stuff to reflect the current focus of the paper. Finer polishing can come later.]}
We also estimate the molecular hydrogen column densities \NHm\ from these linear relationships and hence the OH/\h2\ abundance ratio \xoh, for which few literature measurements exist. The \xoh\ ratios derived from the three \NH\ proxies are basically consistent with mean value around 10$^{-7}$. Since these results are obtained in a wide ranges of longitude $l$ and latitude $b$ with some sightlines through the Galactic plane, it suggests that OH main lines are good tracers of molecular gas in the ISM.

\section{Introduction}
% Stars in our Milky Way are formed in dense, cold clouds of molecular hydrogen, H$_{2}$. Yet there is still much uncertainty surrounding how this molecular gas is formed. It is crucial to understand the physical conditions within these clouds, so that we can begin to understand how warm, diffuse atomic hydrogen gas can be converted into cold and turbulent molecular form. Since molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecule within these clouds, we would ideally study them by observing H$_{2}$ emission lines. However, these regions are extremely cold: their temperature is $\sim10$K -- just above absolute zero -- meaning that H$_{2}$ cannot be excited even the lowest rotational transition. \sout{Instead H$_{2}$ emission is useful only for studying high temperature regions such as the hot post-shock gas in protostellar flows.} Thus, other observable tracers are needed to explore the physical parameters of molecular hydrogen clouds.
%In practice, 
Historically, neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium has been observed via two important radio spectral lines: the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen (\hi) allows us to study the warm atomic medium, as well as the cold atomic precursors to molecular clouds.  The microwave emission from carbon monoxide (CO) is widely used as a proxy for molecular hydrogen, often via the use of an empirical `X-factor' \xco=2.0$\times10^{20}$cm$^{-2}$km$^{-1}$s (\citealt{Bolatto2013}). \par
%CO is the second most abundant chemical within molecular regions and its lowest rotational transition is easily excited at low temperatures. It has been, so far, the most important tracer of molecular hydrogen.%
However, there is increasing evidence for gas that is not seen in either \hi\ or CO. This undetected gas component is often called ``Dark Gas'', following \cite{Grenier2005}. These authors %used data from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET), and 
found an overabundance of diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Local ISM, compared to what would be expected due to cosmic ray interactions with the ambient gas mass as measured via \hi\ and CO. %\textbf{\color{magenta}[Please check my wording here. Also add a sentence saying that many other studies have come to similar conclusions, with lots of \color{blue} REFS!]}. 
Similar conclusions have been reached using many different tracers, including $\gamma$-rays %emission from Fermi Large Area Telescope 
(e.g. \citealt{Abdo2010}, \citealt{Ackermann2012}, \citealt{Ackermann2011}), infra-red emission from dust (e.g. \citealt{Blitz1990, Reach1994, Douglas2007, PLC2011, PLC2014}), dust extinction (e.g. \citealt{Lee2015}), C{\sc i} emission (\citealt{Langer2014}) and OH 18 cm emission and absorption (e.g. \citealt{Wannier93,Liszt1996,Barriault2010, Allen2012, Allen2015}). Observations of \hi\ and CO alone are therefore likely to miss a significant fraction of the total gas mass in the Galaxy.

Interstellar dust provides an alternative means of estimating total gas column densities. Dust is ubiquitous in the ISM, and 
% \sout{Despite of contributing only about 1\%  to the mass of the ISM, it is a crucial constituent for the process of star formation because far-infrared (or infrared?) from dust grains removes the gravitational energy of collapsing clouds.} 
despite contributing only about 1\% of its mass, it is critically important to both its thermal and chemical state. During the star formation process, continuum emission from dust is a major cooling mechanism. %, which contributes to the cooling of the gas and to its gravitational collapse %\textbf{\color{magenta}[Is this just referring to the process of star formation? Otherwise it's not immediately clear how the absorption and re-radiation of stellar radiation would cool gas particles.]}. 
%Dust, in addition, plays an important role in interstellar chemistry: %the chemical reactions between dust and atoms as well as molecules in the ISM: 
In interstellar chemistry, the surfaces of dust grains provide the formation sites for molecular hydrogen \h2, and probably for other simple and complex molecules \textbf{\color{blue}[REF?]}. %as well as complex organic molecules. 
Through the efficient absorption of UV radiation, dust %reduces the ultraviolet (UV) radiation, hence, 
also protects molecules from photodissociation, and acts as a major heating source for interstellar gas via photoelectrons ejected from grains.

% \sout{The relation between gas and dust in molecular cloud is vital to understand the physics properties of the cloud and the star formation activities therein.} 
The relationship between gas and dust is important in understanding the physics of the interstellar medium. Dust is believed to be well mixed with gas in the ISM, it has historically been used as an effective tracer of the total gas column density (e.g. \citealt{Savage1972}, \citealt{Bohlin1978}, \citealt{Goodman2009}): %\sout{\color{magenta}[Is the fact that dust reacts directly to UV radiation directly related to its performance as a proxy for gas column? The current sentence structure makes it sound like it is, but I'm not sure I see the connection.]} 
\citet{Savage1972} and \citet{Bohlin1978} relied on Hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ and absorption lines of \h2\ to determine the total Hydrogen column density; \citet{Reina1973} and \citet{Gorenstein1975} used X-ray absorption and optical extinction to estimate the value of \av/\NH\  \sout{\color{magenta}[Can/should you add a sentence or two here on historical (pre-IRAS) work on relating dust-properties to gas column? I guess Bohlin is the obvious one, which you've already said. Is it true to say that older work would have relied on optical absorption measurements of some kind? If you give this historical context, then the follow on with the advent of IRAS, then the text flows quite nicely.]} With the advent of the all-sky survey by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS, \citealt{Neugebauer1984}) \textbf{\color{blue}[REF?- HIEP: THis sentence is not correct, I should say: With the advent of IRAS, dust would be possibly realized to trace total neutral gas column better than \hi\ and CO: de Vries et al.(1987); Heiles et al.(1988); Blitz et al.(1990) showed the evidences for molecular gas without CO when comparing IRAS 100um survey to surveys of HI and CO. Reach et al. (1994) found a significant infrared emission unaccounted for by observation in 21 cm or 2.6 mm lines in the cloud G236+39, presumably H2 with CO emission below detection threshold. Meyerdierks \& Heithausen (1996) also detected the excess of infra-red to what expected from the HI and CO emission surrounding the Polaris. In the study of Persues star-forming regions, \citet{Goodman2009} claimed that dust seems to trace the "full" mass distribution better than molecular lines over the range of \av=1$-$12 mag]} \sout{FIR emission from dust was found to be a better tracer of total neutral gas column than \hi\ and CO} \sout{\color{blue}[REFS!!]}.\sout{\color{magenta}[Also, the statement is very general. Presumably this work was done in some particular regime/location etc? Should state this]} The emission of interstellar dust in the FIR-to-millimeter range arises mostly from large grains in thermal equilibrium with the ambient local radiation field (ISRF) (\citealt{Draine2003}, \citealt{Draine2007}). \textbf{\color{magenta}[A sentence is needed here explaining that a linear correlation is usually found and/or assumed, with some references, including the later Planck results etc. Be sure to state what measured dust properties are used.]} Many studies have found an %[[the 
excess of dust intensity and dust optical depth above a linear correlation with the total gas column density, %]] / [[the increase in dust emissivity ($I_{\nu}$/\NH) and opacity ($\tau_{\nu}$/\NH) from low to high density regions]] 
in the range of visual extinction \av\ from 0.3 to 2.7 mag %\sout{Av or E(B-V) ? Please specify} 
(\citealt{PLC2011,PLC2014,PlanckInt2014,Martin2012}). This could be explained by (1) the evolution of dust grains across the gas phases; (2) the underestimation of dust opacity due to changes in irradiation and temperature along the line-of-sight %(PLC2014a used one single value of temperature along sight lines for Modified Black Body fit \sout{\color{magenta}[What is MBB fit?]}); 
(3) underestimation of the total gas column due significant cold \hi\ opacity; (4) insufficient sensitivity for CO detection; (5) last but not least, the presence of important amounts of CO-dark \h2. \textbf{\color{magenta}[Do we have some sense of which of these explanations are currently favoured?]}

% \sout{Moreover, comparison between Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) dust images and gas maps in \hi and CO also helps to reveal the apparent 'excess' of dust emission. Ade et al. (Planck collaboration, 2011) obviously show that the dust optical depth excesses off the linear correlation with total gas column density (N$^{tot}_{H}$) within the intermediate extinction range A$_{V} \sim 0.4-2.5$ mag.}

%[\sout{[JO NOTE: Note to remind you that the intro will need to discuss in some detail the issue of whether ``dark gas'' is cold \hi or CO-dark \h2. Suggest including mention of various works arguing for each, plus maybe an explanation of what Grenier, Planck papers have concluded in that regard.]}]

As hinted at by points (3)--(5) above, there is still some debate on the nature of dark gas. %is still poorly understood. 
Some studies have claimed that cold, optically thick \hi\ can account for almost all missing gas mass (\citealt{Fukui2015}). %because \hi\ consists of warm component and cold component. 
This is because while the mass of warm \hi\ can be computed directly from measured line intensities under the optically thin assumption, cold \hi\ with spin temperature $T_{s}$ $\lesssim$ 100K suffers from significant optical depth effects. A common way to overcome this difficulty is to compare \hi\ absorption and emission profiles observed towards (and adjacent to) bright, compact continuum background sources. \textbf{\color{magenta}[Such studies suggest that %on average $\sim10$--30\% of the \hi\ along measured Milky Way sightlines resides in the cold phase 
the optically thin assumption underestimates the true \hi\ column by no more than a few 10\% along most Milky Way sightlines \color{blue}(e.g. Dickey et al. 1983, 2002; Heiles \& Troland 2003, SPONGE papers? Others?)]} More strongly implicated as the main constituent of Dark Gas is CO-dark \h2 (e.g. \citealt{Lee2015} \textbf{\color{blue}[Many more REFS!!]}). This gas resides in diffuse molecular regions %(outer regions/layers of the molecular cloud) 
with the existing threshold $\sim$0.4 mag \sout{approximately half a magnitude of extinction} (\citealt{PLC2011}) slightly higher than predicted from model by \citealt{Wolfire2010} ($\sim$0.2 mag)  \sout{\color{magenta}[What is the origin of this statement? Theory/models? Observations? Might want to give a (little!) bit of context for it. HIEP: I changed the text. It should be the threshold for existence of Dark Gas]}, in which \h2 is effectively self-shielded %itself or is shielded by dust 
%from %the effects of %ultraviolet 
%photodissociation, 
but CO is typically photodissociated (\citealt{Wolfire2010, Glover2010,PLC2011}) \sout{\color{blue}[Should there be REFS here too?]}. This, combined with variations in CO abundance even within CO-bright regions, means that the CO molecule is by no means a perfect tracer of \h2, especially at low column density (\citealt{Tielens1985a}, \citealt{Tielens1985b}, \citealt{vanDishoeck1988} \textbf{\color{magenta}[Do these references belong down here or above? \color{blue} Possible additional modeling citations: Wolfire et al. 2010, Glover \& Mac Low 2011, Glover \& Smith 2016]}. A possible alternative is OH, which is emerging as an effective tracer of diffuse molecular regions (\citealt{Wannier93, Liszt1996, Barriault2010, Allen2012, Allen2015, Xu2016}). We will discuss OH briefly in this work. %thus using \xco-factor to convert CO integral intensity into \h2 column density is not reliable everywhere.

% and molecular gas cannot be traced by the intensity of the 12CO(1-0) line at 115GHz. A significant amount of H$_{2}$ mass may lie outside CO-bright areas, in the outer regions of the molecular cloud, where carbon is in the gas phase of C or C+. Molecular hydrogen here effectively shields itself or is shielded by dust against the effects of ultraviolet photodissociation, whereas CO is photodissociated. This H$_{2}$ gas remains “dark” in most molecular transitions because it does mostly not emit at low temperature; and CO as well as other trace molecules are not present. 

% CO requires \~ 2mag of extinction for protection

% [If the transitions that cause the photodissociation become optically thick due to a large
% number of absorbing particles, then the molecule is said to have self-shielded. The ability for
% a molecule such as H2 to achieve self-shielding arises from it having a large enough density
% relative to the photon density such that all of the dissociating photons are absorbed before
% reaching molecules further within the cloud. In a sense, a sacrificial layer of H 2 molecules
% forms and absorbs the dissociating photons (by dissociating into atomic H) allowing interior
% H 2 molecules to survive. The sacrificial region, which consists of atomic and molecular
% hydrogen, is called the dissociation front and lies in the outer regions of a molecular cloud
% in the direction of an ultraviolet source. These regions form the outermost boundary of a
% molecular cloud.]

In this study, we examine the correlations between accurately-derived \hi\ column densities and several dust-based proxies for $N_\mathrm{H}$. %Or sample covers a wide range of visual extinctions \textbf{\color{magenta}[ sightlines through the Milky Way and Local ISM. %In order to obtain good constrains on the total gas column density, it is required to solve the two difficulties on \hi\ opacity effect and the large uncertainty of \xco. To deal with the (former/) first one, 
We make use of opacity-corrected \hi\ column densities derived from two surveys: the Arecibo Millennium Survey (\citealt{Heiles2003b}), and 21-SPONGE (\citealt{Murray2015}), both of which used on-/off-source measurements towards extragalactic point sources to derive accurate physical properties of the atomic ISM. We also make use of archival OH data from the Millennium Survey, recently published for the first time in a companion paper, Li et al. (in prep), combining it with our dust data to constrain the OH/\h2\ abundance ratio. %(\citealt{Heiles2003b}). For the (latter/) second one, we then consider only the lines-of-sight where molecular gas is not detected: 19 lines-of-sight without CO and OH dectection and 16 lines-of-sight with low \hi\ column density (low enough to assume there is not significant amount of molecular gas along the lines-of-sight).

%\sout{Due to the large uncertainty of X-factor converting CO integral intensity into \h2\ column density, we are ONLY interested in 26 sight-lines where CO emission lines are NOT detected. JO NOTE: Note to remind you to justify this decision in the context of the science we wish to do (which we will have laid out already in the intro probably.)}

%\sout{[JO NOTE: This intro is really good! But it will probably need to be modified once the content of the paper is locked down, since (1) at present it focuses heavily on CO-dark H2, which this work actually only has limited ability to probe, (2) some more background on the dust will be needed.]}

The structure of this article is as follows. In Section 2, the observations and the data processing techniques are briefly summarized. We then describe the results on \hi\ in Section 3. In Section 4, the results from OH observations are discussed. Section 5 shows the featured outcomes from the dust and gas in the ISM. We finally estimate the OH/\h2\ abundance ratio in Section 6, before concluding in Section 7. \textbf{\color{magenta}[Note to remind me (Jo) to check this again after reading the entire paper.]}

\section{Datasets}
In this study, we use the all-sky optical depth (\t353) and radiance (\rad) maps of the dust model data measured by Planck/IRAS (\citealt{PLC2014} -- hereafter PLC2014a), %\sout{[JO NOTE: Do you mean the Radiance map? I thought E(B-V) was from Shafley?]}

\label{sec:observations}

\subsection{\hi\ and OH}
\label{subsec:data_hi_oh}
%\sout{When use values in table? When use spectral data?}
We use \hi\ data from the Millennium Arecibo 21-Centimeter Absorption-Line Survey (hereafter MS), which was taken towards 79 strong radio sources (typically S $\gtrsim 2$ Jy) with the L-wide receiver. % throughout out the Milky Way. 
The two main lines of ground state OH at 1665.402 and 1667.359 MHz were observed simultaneously towards 49 positions, and
% Briefly, they applied the so-called Z17 ON/OFF-source measurements in which $50\%$ of the integration time was spent ON source, the remaining time for 16 OFF positions around the source. The bandwidth of the observations is 0.78 MHz, with the channel width of 381 KHz, corresponding to a velocity resolution of 0.068 \kms. A RMS of 28 mK per channel was achieved with 2 hours of total integration time.
OH absorption was detected along 21 of these sightlines \citep[see also][]{Li2017}. The observations are described in detail by HT03. In this work we directly adopt the results of HT03 for the total \hi\ column density, \NHI (scaled as described below), and use the off-source MS emission profiles to compute the optically-thin \hi\ column density, \NHIthin where required. 

In order to improve the statistics, we also use \hi\ data from the Very Large Array (VLA) 21-SPONGE Survey, which observed 30 continuum sources, including 14 in-common with the Millennium Survey sample (\citealt{Murray2015}). 21-SPONGE used on-source absorption data from the VLA, combining it with off-source emission profiles observed with Arecibo. The total number of unique sightlines presented in this work is therefore 94. The locations of all observed sources in Galactic coordinates are presented in Figure \ref{fig:src_locations}.

In keeping with \citet{Murray2015}, we find that \NHIthin\ from 21-SPONGE is higher than the MS values by a factor of about 1.26, where this difference arises %from differences in the processing of the two datasets, including 
primarily from different choices of beam efficiency, $\eta_{b}$. 
Following \citet{Murray2015}, we scale the MS data to the 21-SPONGE intensity scale by dividing by a factor of $\eta_{b} = 1/1.26 \approx 0.8$. We opt to apply this factor directly to the \NHI\ presented in HT03, rather than re-derive those values from scaled spectral data. This approach is appropriate for all but the faintest and most optically thin sightlines, for which we estimate it will result in no more than a $\sim10\%$ overestimate of the true \NHI. \textbf{\color{magenta}[I messed around with the numbers in HT03 Table 2 to come up with this figure. We should discuss and check it.]} %is appropriate to apply this factor directly to both the MS \NHI and \NHIthin. 

\begin{figure*}

  \label{fig:src_locations}
\end{figure*}

%In Figure \ref{fig:thin_nhi_ms_sp} we compare the optically thin \hi\ column densities, \NHIthin, of the 14 sightlines common to both the MS and 21-SPONGE. It can be seen that \NHIthin\ from 21-SPONGE is higher than the MS values by a factor of about 1.26. The difference arises because HT03 assumed a beam efficiency, $\eta_{b},$ of unity for the MS. %from the beam efficiency $\eta_{b}$ of Arecibo telescope since its beam efficiency was not applied to MS data in HT03 (or// since its beam efficiency was assumed to be unity in HT03). \sout{[JO NOTE: Not quite. It's that Carl did not apply a beam efficiency to the MS data. Once the correct value is applied, the results are consistent.]}, 
%In agreement with \citet{Murray2015}, we find that a value of $\eta_{b} = 0.8$ is required to explain the .  also found that if a beam efficiency factor of 0.81 is applied to HT03 emission profiles, they will agree with the beam-efficiency-scaled emission profiles from 21-SPONGE survey. Hence, in this work we will scale \NHI\ from HT03 by the factor of 1.26.%\sout{[JO NOTE: Nice explanation! Probably need to move it to the observations section though, since it's really just a data correction...? I suppose the issue of why it's OK to also correct the optically thick columns by the same factor might bear a couple of sentences of explanation, but I think that can also come in the observations section, particularly if you clarify there that you do not re-do Carl's \hi analysis, and just use the values in his table.]}

% In the cases of common sources, the results from the 21-SPONGE survey are taken.

\subsection{CO}
\label{subsec:CO}
As described in \citet{Li2017}, a CO follow-up survey was conducted towards the 48 MS sightlines observed in OH. The J=1--0 transitions of \co, \13co, and \c18o\ were observed with the Delingha 13.7m telescope in China. \co(J=2--1) data for 45 sources and J=3--2 data for 8 sources with strong \co\ emission were taken with the 10.4m Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) on Mauna Kea. In this work we use CO data solely to identify and exclude from some parts of the analysis positions with detected CO-bright molecular gas -- comprising 26 of the 48 observed positions. These positions are identified in Figure \ref{fig:src_locations}. %The astronomical software package Gildas/CLASS\footnote{$http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/$} was used for reducing spectroscopic CO data obtained from single-dish telescopes. \par
%    \sout{[Due to the large uncertainty of X-factor converting CO integral intensity into \h2\ column density, we are ONLY interested in 26 sight-lines where CO emission lines are NOT detected.

The \t353\ map was obtained by a modified black-body (MBB) fit to the first 15 months of 353, 545, and 857 GHz data, together with IRAS 100 micron data. For details, see Planck Collaboration (2013) \textbf{\color{blue}[flagged to include proper citation key]}. Both datasets have angular resolutions of 5 arcmin. In this work we use the R1.20 data release in Healpix\footnote{$http://healpix.sourceforge.net$} format (\citealt{Gorski2005}). %\sout{JO NOTE: I thought Marc-Antoine said not to use the Planck \ebv\ because it was essentially just a linear rescaling of another quantity (tau? R? I forget!)]}
As an alternative proxy for \NH, we also employ the all-sky \ebv\ map of \citealt{Schlafly2011}, which used the spectral colors of stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 

\section{\hi}
\label{sec:hi}
As mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:data_hi_oh}, the total \hi\ column densities \NHI\ were derived along 94 sightlines from Millennium and 21-SPONGE surveys (HT03, \citealt{Murray2015}). In order to understand how much \hi\ could be underestimated from the optically thin assumption (i.e optical depth $\tau \ll 1$), we use the ``expected emission profiles'' from HT03 to compute the optically thin \hi\ column density \sout{[JO NOTE: Note to remind you that the intro will need to discuss in some detail the issue of whether ``dark gas'' is cold \hi\ or CO-dark \h2. Suggest including mention of various works arguing for each, plus maybe an explanation of what Grenier, Planck papers have concluded in that regard.]} (\NHIthin):

\begin{equation}
N^{*}_{HI} = 1.8224 \times 10^{18} W_{HI} \ (cm^{-2})
\label{eq_nhi_thin} 
\end{equation}

\noindent where W$_{HI}$ is the \hi\ integrated intensity.

\sout{In Figure \ref{fig:thin_nhi_ms_sp} we compare the optically thin \hi\ column densities, \NHIthin, of 14 common sightlines from  Arecibo Millennium Survey (MS) and 21-SPONGE survey. \NHIthin\ from 21-SPONGE survey is obviously higher than from MS about 26\%, the difference is due to the difference between the beam efficiency $\eta_{b}$ of Arecibo telescope and VLA [JO NOTE: Not quite. It's that Carl did not apply a beam efficiency to the MS data. Once the correct value is applied, the results are consistent.], 26\% corresponds to $\eta_{b} = 0.8$. Murray2015 also found that if a beam efficiency factor of 0.81 is applied to HT03 emission profiles, they will agree with the beam-efficiency-scaled emission profiles from 21-SPONGE survey. Hence, in this work we will scale \NHI\ from HT03 by the factor of 1.26.[JO NOTE: Nice explanation! Probably need to move it to the observations section though, since it's really just a data correction...? I suppose the issue of why it's OK to also correct the optically thick columns by the same factor might bear a couple of sentences of explanation, but I think that can also come in the observations section, particularly if you clarify there that you do not re-do Carl's \hi\ analysis, and just use the values in his table.] }

%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{fig/nhi_scale_factor.eps}
%\caption{Comparison between optically thin \hi\ column densities \NHIthin\ from 21-SPONGE survey (SP) and Arecibo Millennium survey (MS) along 14 common sightlines. The linear fit (solid line) shows that \NHIthin\ from 21-SPONGE survey is higher than it from Millennium survey by a factor of 1.26. The dash line represents the case if they are equal.}
%\label{fig:thin_nhi_ms_sp}
%\end{figure}

The \NHIthin\ estimates are made using the optically thin assumption $\tau_{H} \ll 1$ and should give an underestimate in cases where there is appreciable cold gas. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ratio_vs_nhithin}, if we use the optically thin assumption, there are 14/94 sight-lines where the true column density \NHI\ is underestimated more than 25\%, mostly in high column density region. On average, the \hi\ mass increases by $\sim$10\% compared to the optically thin assumption  - i.e. an opacity correction. This is consistent with \citet{Lee2015} for the case of Persues molecular cloud [the typical value ($\sim$10\%) throughout the Galaxy (XX et. al xxxx)???].

Figure \ref{fig:ratio_vs_nhithin} shows the correlation between \NHI\ and \NHIthin\ towards all 94 positions. It is obvious that the ratio \NHI/\NHIthin\ increases linearly as the function of the ten-base logarithm of (\NHIthin/10$^{20}$) with the slope of 0.22$\pm$0.03 and the offset of 0.88$\pm$0.02. This linear trend is consistent with its from \citealt{Lee2015} (slope: 0.32$\pm$0.06, offset: 0.81$\pm$0.05) for the case of Persus molecular cloud and HT03 (slope: 0.26$\pm$0.08, offset: 0.91$\pm$0.04 shown in Figure 13 in \citealt{Lee2015}). These may suggest a general relation between \NHI\ and \NHIthin\ through out the Milky Way due to the large ranges for both Galactic latitude and longitude of the observed sightlines. If this is the case, optically thin \hi\ column density \NHIthin\ might be considered as the proxy for the total \hi\ column density \NHI. \textbf{[We should probably discuss exactly what you want to say here. And also compare mor with other work (I think there have been many studies on this - let's ask Snez). Also, do other people usually express this relation in terms of a ``cold gas fraction''? Check for consistency.]}

\section{Derivation of Optical Depth, Excitation Temperature and Column Density for OH(1665) and OH(1667)}
\label{sec:derive_tex}

\textbf{[JO NOTE: Some comment on relation to published (?) Ningyu/Di paper?]}

The radiative transfer equations for ON/OFF source measurements can be written as:
\begin{equation}
T_A^{ON}(v) =(T_{bg}-T_{c})e^{-\tau_{v}} + T_{ex}(1-e^{-\tau_{v}}) + T_{rx}
\label{eq_ton}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T_A^{OFF}(v)=T_{bg}e^{-\tau_{v}} + T_{ex}(1-e^{-\tau_{v}}) + T_{rx}
\label{eq_toff} 
\end{equation}

\sout{[JO NOTE: Clarify meaning of Trx]}
\noindent Here $T_A^{OFF} (v)$ and $T_A^{ON} (v)$ are the (continuum-included) antenna temperatures of the emission line and the absorption line respectively. $T_{ex}$ is the excitation temperature, $\tau_{v}$ is the optical depth and $T_{c}$ is the antenna temperature of the continuum source, which is assumed to be smaller than the main beam of the telescope. $T_{bg}$ is the background brightness temperature including the 2.7K isotropic radiation from CMB and the Galactic synchrotron background at the source position. In the following, we estimate the synchrotron contribution at 1665.402 MHz and 1667.359 MHz from the 408MHz continuum map (\citealt{Haslam1982}) by adopting a temperature spectral index of 2.8, such that
\begin{equation}
T_{bg} = 2.7 + T_{bg408}(\nu_{OH}/408.)^{2.8},
\label{eq4c} 
\end{equation}
\noindent resulting in typical values of around 3.5 K. The  background continuum contribution from Galactic HII regions may be safely ignored, since the continuum sources we observed are either at high Galactic latitudes or Galactic Anti-Center longitudes. $T_{rx}$ is the receiver temperature with the average of $\sim 50$ K in Stokes I parameter (or $\sim25$ K in brightness temperature). Thus, apart from the line (meaning the baseline of emission spectrum), the off-source temperature is:
\begin{equation}
T_A^{OFF}(v)= T_{bg} + T_{rx}
\label{eq_toff_offline}
\end{equation}
In the absence of information about the true gas distribution, we assume that OH clouds cover fully both the continuum source and the main beam of the telescope. The beam efficiency is of Arecibo telescope at 1666MHz is $\sim0.48$, \sout{which is a reasonable assumption for Arecibo} for which $\sim90\%$ of the power is contained within the main beam and inner sidelobe. Therefore, we can assume that the antenna temperature equals the brightness temperature of the OH lines ????.
In this work we use a simple method solving the two Transfer Equations (equations \ref{eq_ton} and (\ref{eq_toff})) on a channel-by-channel basis to derive the excitation temperature $T_{ex}$ and the optical depth $\tau_{v}$ for OH(1665) and OH(1667):
\begin{equation}
e^{-\tau_{v}} = \frac{T_A^{ON}(v) - T_A^{OFF}(v)}{T_{c}}
\label{eq_etau} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T_{ex} = \frac{T_A^{OFF}(v)-T_{bg}e^{-\tau_{v}} - T_{rx}}{1-e^{-\tau_{v}}}
\label{eq_tex}
\end{equation}
\noindent The procedure is described as follows: \par
1. Compute the opacity spectrum $e^{-\tau_{v}}$ (as well as optical depth spectrum $\tau_{v}$ and its RMS $\sigma_{\tau_{v}}$) by using equation \ref{eq_etau}. \par
2. Fit the OH opacity spectrum with a set of N-Gaussian components to estimate the physical properties of OH clouds along the line-of-sight, each component is assumed to correspond to a single OH clump: \sout{[JO NOTE: reword to make it clear that Gaussian fits only used to later identify positions of lines.tx]}
\begin{equation}
\tau(v) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} \tau_{0,n}e^{-[(v-v_{0,n})/\delta v_{n}]^2}. 
\label{tau_ngauss} 
\end{equation}
\noindent This least-squares fit gives the values of peak optical depth ($\tau_{0,n}$), central velocity ($v_{0,n}$) and width ($\delta v_{n}$) for component $n$. The Gaussian fits in this step are only used to identify the positions and the widths of OH main lines. \par
3. Use the equation \ref{eq_tex} to calculate the excitation temperature spectrum, $T_{ex}$. It is apparently obvious that $T_{ex}$ spectra are flat within the width of Gaussian components (as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:example_p042820}). Hence, we choose only the range within the width $\delta v_{n}$ from $(v_{0,n}-\delta v_{n}/2)$ to $(v_{0,n}-\delta v_{n}/2)$ to calculate the mean values of $T_{ex}$ for each Gaussian component. For the case of 3C123, we adopted the value of T$_{bg}$ to be 25.0 K (reason why??).

\par
4. Compute the column densities of OH(1667) and OH(1665) components independently using the following equations:
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{OH}(1667)}=\frac{8\pi kT_{ex,1667}{{\nu}^2_{1667}}}{A_{1667}c^{3}h}\frac{16}{5}\int\tau_{1667}dv\ (cm^{-2})
\label{eq_noh67}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{OH}(1665)}=\frac{8\pi kT_{ex,1665}{{\nu}^2_{1665}}}{A_{1665}c^{3}h}\frac{16}{3}\int\tau_{1665}dv \ (cm^{-2})
\label{eq_noh65}
\end{equation}
where $A_{1667}=7.778\times 10^{-11} s^{-1}$ and $A_{1665}=7.177\times 10^{-11} s^{-1}$ are the Einstein A-coefficients for the OH main lines (\citealt{Destombes1977}). Substituting the constants into the above equations, they can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{N_{\mathrm{OH}(1667)}}{[10^{14}cm^{2}]}=2.39 \cdot \tau_{1667} \cdot \frac{T_{ex,1667}}{[K]} \cdot \frac{\delta v_{1667}}{[km s^{-2}]}
\label{eq_noh67rd}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{N_{\mathrm{OH}(1665)}}{[10^{14}cm^{2}]}=4.30 \cdot \tau_{1665} \cdot \frac{T_{ex,1665}}{[K]} \cdot \frac{\delta v_{1665}}{[km s^{-2}]}
\label{eq_noh65rd}
\end{equation}

\noindent Our results from this channel-to-channel basis method are consistent with it from Li et al. 2017 (in preparation) using the Gaussian decomposition method. We agree with their conclusions namely the optical depths for the OH main lines satisfy the optically-thin assumption and, in general, the two main lines are not in LTE. The values are tabulated in Table \ref{table:OH-parameters}, and discussed further below. The comparisons of $\tau$ and \Tex\ obtained from the 2 methods are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tex_tau_compare}. In general, they are closely consistent, the ratios of \Tex\ and $\tau$ are mostly around unity, some spread points come from the sighlines (G197.0+1.1, T0629+10) located in the Galactic plane where the emission and absorption spectra are not simple to analyze.

\section{ Proxies for Total neutral gas\\ column density}
\label{sec:proxies-for-nh}
In this section we will study the correlations between dust properties (dust optical depth at 353 GHz \t353, dust radiance \rad, reddening \ebv) and the total gas column density \NH. Many proxies have recently been used to estimate \NH, generally with the assumption that a single linear relationship holds between the proxy and \NH. Sample of emission/absorption pairs gives us accurate \hi\ column densities in the low-to-moderate range (1$-$122)$\times10^{20}$cm$^{-2}$, OH and CO data allow us to exclude all those with molecular gas (dark or not). This means we can compare the performance of the various proxies (within this range), and investigate departures from linearity seen by PLC2014a. %\sout{[JO NOTE: With what aim? Good to give a bit of context here. Presumably the point is that many proxies are used for total NH, generally with the assumption that a single linear relationship holds between the proxy and NH. Our sample of emission/absorption pairs gives us accurate \hi gas columns in the low-to-moderate column density range, and our OH and CO data allows us to exclude all those with molecular gas (dark or not). This means we can compare the performance of the various proxies (within this range), and investigate departures from linearity seen by e.g. Planck collaboration (2014)]}
In order to simplify the problem, we will consider only 19 sightlines where neither CO nor OH is detected and 16 sightlines with low \NHI\ (\NHI$<$3.0$\times$$10^{20}cm^{-2}$). We do not unfortunately have either CO data for all low-\NHI\ sightlines or OH data for 5 of them, but 11 of the 16 sightlines are without OH detection. Sightlines having \NHI$<$3.0$\times$$10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ are considered too low to %seek for molecular tracers/too low to form 
host a significant amount of \h2\, %and therefore molecular tracers (Planck Collaboration 2011) 
since the column of atomic hydrogen is too low to shield a molecular region against dissociation by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). %\sout{[JO NOTE: define what is meant by this. They were considered too low to seek for molecular tracers?]} 
Thus, we are confident to assume that there is only neutral hydrogen along these 35 sightlines, all of them are outside the Galactic plane $|$b$|$$>$10$^{o}$. Figure \ref{fig:src_examples} shows the examples of 4 sightlines in the maps of \t353, \ebv, dust radiance and dust temperature. %\sout{[JO NOTE: Stress this is an excellent assumption]}.

Note that as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:hi}, the Millennium Survey \hi\ column densities derived by HT03 have been scaled by the beam efficiency of ~0.79, corresponding to the factor of 1.26.

\subsection{ \NH\ from dust optical depth \t353}
\label{subsec:nh-from-t353}
We adopt the all-sky map of dust optical depth \t353 deduced by Planck Collaboration 2014 from modified black body (MBB) empirical fit using IRAS and Planck satellite maps at 3000, 857, 545 and 353 GHz %\sout{\color{red}[JO (16/6/17): make it clear that its not us who did this work]}:

\begin{equation}
I_{\nu} = \tau_{353}B_{\nu}(T_{obs})(\frac{\nu}{353})^{\beta_{obs}}
\label{eq_mbbfit}
\end{equation}

\noindent Optical depth \t353, dust temperature $T_{obs}$ and spectral index $\beta_{obs}$ are three parameters. $B_{\nu}(T_{obs})$ is the Planck function for dust at temperature $T_{obs}$ which is, in this model, considered to be uniform along the sightlines (see PLC2014a for more details).

In the optically thin limit, the relation between dust optical depth \t353 and total gas column density \NH\ can be described as following:

\begin{equation}
\tau_{353} = \frac{I_{353}}{B_{353}(T_{obs})} = \kappa_{0}\ r\ \mu \ m_{H}\ N_{H} 
= \sigma_{353} \ N_{H}
\label{eq_t353_nh}
\end{equation}

\noindent with \s353\ being the dust opacity, %(also known as conversion factor \sout{\color{red}[JO (16/6/17): Confirm: do other people actually call it that or is it just me?! ONLY YOU I RECKON :)]} ), 
$\kappa_{0}$ the dust emissivity cross-section per unit mass ($cm^{2} g^{-1}$), $r$ the dust-to-gas mass ratio, $\mu$ the mean molecular weight and $m_{H}$ the mass of Hydrogen atom.

Figure \ref{fig:tau_vs_nhi} shows the correlation between  \NH\ and \t353. A strong linear trend can be seen with a Pearson coefficient of 0.96. The value of %conversion factor
\s353\ from the ODR linear fit is $(6.8{\pm}0.3){\times}10^{-27}$cm$^{2}$H$^{-1}$ (blue line), %It is worth noting that the data points are varied/fluctuated ??? further away from the linear line from lower to higher column density regime. 
highly consistent with that obtained by Planck collaboration (2014), $(6.6\pm 1.7){\times}10^{-27}$cm$^{2}$H$^{-1}$ (black line). %\sout{[[JO NOTE: Will need some explanation on the two values from the Planck paper, what they mean, and why the black one is thought to be the best one. Can/should we consider fitting just the low column density points (as Marc-Antoine did to get the black line) and seeing what we get?]]}. 
However, a systematic deviation of data points below the fit line is obvious at higher column densities; this indicates the excess of \t353\ over the linear correlation with \NH, which is also seen in low \NHI\ (see Figure 19 in PLC2014a). We will discuss this further below.

The dust opacity \s353\ from \citealt{Fukui2015} is also illustrated as a black line; they derived a smaller value (factor of $\sim$0.7) by restricting the fit to only the warmest dust temperatures, under the assumption that these most reliably select for genuinely optically thin \hi. %under the assumption that optically thick \hi can be recovered based on dust temperatures (??? or something ???). 
Their \s353\ is significantly different to what we find using accurately measured \hi\ column densities, and by extension, applying their value to \t353 at our source positions significantly overestimates \NHI. Our results therefore appear to be inconsistent with their picture that the dark ISM in the Milky Way is dominated by CNM. %\textbf{[JO NOTE: Some careful wording will be needed here, but this is OK for the moment.]}

\label{fig:tau_vs_nhi}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ \NH\ from dust radiance \rad}
\label{subsec:nh-from-radiance}
Dust radiance (also known as dust integrated intensity) is defined from PLC2014a as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
R = \int_{\nu}^{} I_{\nu} d\nu = \int_{\nu}^{} \tau_{353}B_{\nu}(T_{obs})(\frac{\nu}{353})^{\beta_{obs}} d\nu\\
= G_{0}\ \sigma_{a}\ r\ \mu \ m_{H}\ N_{H}
\end{split}
\label{eq_r_nh}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $G_{0}$ is the ambient radiation field intensity, %\sout{[JO NOTE: Stars can be anywhere, not necessarily nearby - G0 is just the ambient radiation field.]}, 
$\sigma_{a}$ is the absorption cross-section of dust grain proportional to the area looked by the coming radiation. These two quantities do not vary immensely in the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitude, and are usually considered as constants.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{fig/r_vs_nh.eps}
\caption{ Dust radiance \rad\ as the function of total gas column density \NH\ along 35 atomic sightlines (19 sightlines without CO and OH detection and 16 sightlines with low \NHI).}
\label{fig:r_vs_nh}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:r_vs_nh} plots \rad\ as the function of \NH. A linear fit was performed with the slope of $(4.05\pm 0.32)\times 10^{31} W^{-1}sr$, which is in agreement with the value of $(3.75\pm 0.08)\times 10^{31} W^{-1}sr$ obtained by PLC2014a. The Pearson coefficient is 0.974 -- slightly higher than for \t353. 

%Something like linearly-correlated better than \t353.

\subsection{ \NH\ from dust reddening \ebv}
\label{subsec:nh-from-ebv}
Reddening caused by the %\textbf{[HIEP: Please correct me here]} 
absorption and scattering of light by dust and other matter in the interstellar medium is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E(B{-}V) = \frac{A_{V}}{R_{V}} = \frac{ \sigma_{a} }{ R_{V} } r\ \mu \ m_{H}\ N_{H}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \av\ is the dust extinction, $R_V$ is an empirical coefficient correlated with the average size of the dust grains causing the extinction. In the Milky Way, the typical value for $R_{V}$ is 3.1 (\citealt{Schultz1975}) but varies between 2.5 and 6.0 along different sightlines (\citealt{Draine2003}, \citealt{Goodman1995}).

\citealt{Bohlin1978} found the average value of the ratio \NH/\ebv\ to be $5.8\times 10^{21}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$ mag$^{-1}$ (or $\langle$ \ebv/\NH $\rangle$ = $1.72\times 10^{-22}$ mag cm$^{2}$) using the spectral region near $L_{\alpha}$ obtained from Copernicus satellite survey data toward 100 stars. PLC2014a also estimated the ratio \ebv\ using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) measurements of 105 783 quasars in the area of 8400 deg$^{2}$ mostly in the northern Galactic hemisphere. They found the ratio \ebv/\NH=(1.42$-$1.46)$\times$10$^{-22}$ mag cm$^{2}$, a factor 0.82-0.85 lower than measured by \citealt{Bohlin1978}. %\textbf{(HIEP: REASON WHY?? WE MAY NOT NEED TO MENTION REASONS WHY HERE)}

In this study, we use the all-sky map of \ebv\ from \cite{Schlafly2011} to estimate the ratio \ebv/\NH\ as displayed in Figure \ref{fig:ebv_vs_nh}. It can be seen that \ebv\ and \NH\ are strongly linearly correlated, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.988. \ebv\ does not widely deviate from a linear correlation with \NH\ because, similarly to dust radiance, it depends on the absorption properties of dust grains, $\sigma_{a}$ in fact, which changes but less than $\kappa_0$ \sout{which does not change much with dust evolution} \sout{M.A: it changes but less than $\kappa_0$}. The obtained ratio \ebv/\NH=(1.08$\pm$0.07)$\times$10$^{-22}$ mag cm$^{2}$, a factor 0.63 lower than the ratio from \cite{Bohlin1978} and 0.75 times lower than it from PLC2014a. %\sout{[JO NOTE: Use same convention as above - i.e. 0.63 times Bohlin's value etc. As for the interpretation and wider discussion here, I think we need to know more about why Bohlin's treatment might be expected to differ from ours, and factors like (e.g.) whether we might expect limitations arising from our limited column density range. Some discussion and reading needed.]}

\label{fig:ebv_vs_nh}
\end{figure}

We also plot \ebv\ map achieved from PLC2014a (Release 1.2) versus our \NH\ in lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:ebv_vs_nh}. The average value of derived \ebv/\NH\ ratio is 1.34$\times$10$^{-22}$mag cm$^{2}$. This corresponds to a factor 0.93 lower compared to their ratio \ebv/\NH=(1.42$-$1.46)$\times$10$^{-22}$mag cm$^{2}$. \sout{[JO NOTE: suggest displaying Figs 7 and 8 together as two panels of the same figure. Hiep: Yes, I thought like this earlier when I was plotting these figures.]}

\subsection{ Evolution of dust grains from \s353}
\label{subsec:evolution-of-dust}
Many efforts have been undertaken using the correlations between \t353 and \NH, particularly with regards to the search for ``dark gas'' [\textbf{citations needed! \citealt{PLC2011}, \citealt{Fukui2015}}]. It is clear that \t353 and \NH\ are linearly correlated only if \s353 is a constant. However, PLC2014a showed that \s353 varies with \NH\ (see Figure \ref{fig:s353_vs_nh}), namely, it is roughly flat at a minimum in the narrow range of low gas column density \NH=(1$-$3)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$ \sout{\color{red}[JO (16/6/17): Maybe state that this is the range in which estimates of \NHI\ in that paper were considered reliable?]}, then increases by almost the factor of 2 at higher column density \NH=15$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$. The origin of variations in \s353 may relate to the change in dust properties via $\kappa_{0}$, but may also include a ``dark gas'' contribution through \NH\ itself. Our column density range \NH=(3$\sim$30)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$ fortunately overlaps with the place where deviations begin to be seen, hence we are in a position to test the dark gas hypothesis versus the dust properties one. %\sout{[JO NOTE: Probably good to describe here efforts that have been undertaken using this relationship, particularly with regards to the search for ``dark gas''. This is a good place to contrast Fukui's treatment with others, and mention something about the range of sigma values, and the change in sigma with \hi column that was observed by Marc-Antoine. State that the origin of variations in sigma may be dust properties (Marc-Antoine could advise on an appropriately sophisticated explanation), but may also include a dark gas contribution. State that our column density range overlaps with the place where deviations begin to be seen, hence we are in a position to test the dark gas hypothesis vs the dust properties one.]}

To understand the reason why we have the fluctuation of data points out of the linear trend, especially, the systematic offset above the best fit line at higher column densities %\sout{[JO NOTE: ``scattering'' may not be the best word. You mean the systematic offset above the best fit line at higher columns, right?]} 
as seen in Figure \ref{fig:tau_vs_nhi}, we also deduce our own dust opacity \s353\ from Planck \t353\ data and the true \hi\ column densities. %\textbf{\color{red}[JO (16/6/17): This is sort of repetitious now - we have already discussed the offset above, and indeed expect to see it. And it would probably be trivial to mention the numerical value of our $\sigma_{353}$ when we initially present the linear correlation above. Therefore I think some minor reorganisation is required]}. 
We plot \s353\ as the function of total gas column density \NH\ in Figure \ref{fig:s353_vs_nh} superimposed on the result from PLC2014a. Similarly to Planck data, we can also see the ``up-kick'' in the column density range of (5$\sim$30)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$.

\end{figure}

From equation \ref{eq_t353_nh}, the emission cross-section $\kappa_{0}$ is variable since it depends on the composition and structure of dust grain. The other factors are either constants or slightly change. \sout{M.A: I don't understand the next sentence.} \sout{HIEP: I wrote something unclear, sorry. I want to say: NH is in fact true NHI, no molecular H2} {\em The total gas column densities are indeed the true column densities of \hi\ along atomic sightlines.} Thus, we can explain that the \textbf{scattering/fluctuations ???} seen in Figure \ref{fig:tau_vs_nhi} are due to the variation of the emission cross-section $\kappa_{0}$ [because $\kappa_{0}$ is the division of extinction cross-section over the dust mass, it depends on size of large grains. $\kappa_{0}$ of a dust grain is inversely proportional to its size, the bigger grain would have smaller $\kappa_{0}$. But \cite{Kohler2012} claim that during the coagulation of particles into fluffy dust grain (or "Grain-grain coagulation into fluffy aggregates"), $\kappa_{0}$ apparently increases by a factor of 2-3 for silicate grains with the size range relevant of the ISM]. \sout{M.A: Why didi you put the previous sentence between [] ? To me this it the main explanation.} The ``up-kick'' seen in Figure \ref{fig:s353_vs_nh} is caused by the dust evolution from lower column density to higher column density regime. This rising of \s353\ is truly existing and is not caused by any unaccounted dark gas. \sout{\color{red}[JO (16/6/17): I don't quite follow this explanation on $\kappa_0$. Won't the sticking together of dust grains \textit{reduce} the total available surface area? Flagged for Marc-Antoine's comment.]}

%  \sout{Denser gas leads to higher dust density, dust grains collide to each other more frequently, small dust grains stick onto the surface of bigger dust grain through coagulation, hence the total surface area of the final dust grain increases. Since the dust emission in sub-mm range originates mostly from bigger dust grains in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field; moreover, the emission capability of any object depends on its total area and controversially its absorption capability is proportional to the projected area perpendicular to the direction of coming-radiations, larger surface area enhances the emission cross-section $\kappa_{0}$ of dust grain.} 

\subsection{ Possible presence of ``dark gas''}
\label{subsec:possible-dark-gas}

Follow the PLC2014a, we also plot in Figure \ref{fig:lh_vs_nh} the dust specific luminosity \LH=4$\pi$\rad/\NH\ as the function of \NH. Both data sets show that \LH\ decreases/drops where \NH$<$1.2$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$ and keeps roughly constant at a minimum in small range 1.2$\times$$10^{20}$$<$\NH$<$3$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$. However, while they see the rise of \LH\ from $\sim$3.2$\times$10$^{-31}$ to $\sim$4.5$\times$10$^{-31}$WH$^{-1}$ in column density range (3$-$15)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$ then the drop of \LH\ from 5$\times$10$^{-31}$ to 3$\times$10$^{-31}$WH$^{-1}$ in the range \NH=(15$-$50)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$, we notice that it is still constant (red data points). Because we consider sightlines containing only \hi, this means (/meaning) that their shape of the deviation of \LH\ within gas column densities from (3$-$50)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$ can be explained by (1) the presence of ``dark gas'' or (2) the change in G$_{0}$. \sout{\color{red}[JO NOTE: I removed my incomplete text here. Just a note that this explanation needs to be crystal clear and also well backed up by whatever text has preceded this part of the paper.]}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{fig/LH_vs_nh.eps}
\caption{\LH\ vs \NH\ along 35 atomic sightlines. \LH\ computed at 30$'$ resolution from PLC2014a is also superimposed, blue for CO X-factor \xco=1.0$\times$$10^{20}$, black for \xco=2.0$\times$$10^{20}$ and violet for \xco=3.0$\times$$10^{20}$. Dot-dashed horizontal line represents the average value of $<$\LH$>$ found in low \NHI\ mask, (1$-$4$)\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$, dashed line for $<$\LH$>$ from PLC2014a.}
\label{fig:lh_vs_nh}
\end{figure}

But it is worth noting that the ``hump'' shape in Figure \ref{fig:lh_vs_nh} from PLC2014a data is seen in the range of \NH=(3$-$50)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to the visual extinction \av\ from (0.17$-$2.78) mag and peak at \NH$\sim$15$\times$ 10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$ (or \av$\sim$0.8 mag). This \av\ range is consistent with the \av\ range where ``dark gas'' can be observed (\citealt{PLC2015}): if \av\ is low, \h2\ is destroyed by UV photo-dissociation and in high \av\ regions, CO can be formed and therefore \h2\ would be traced by CO, the peak is found at \av$\sim$0.8 mag where \h2\ has already formed and achieved self-shielding but CO has not formed. \LH\ then increases massively after the hump because the radiation field intensity, $G_0$, increases due to the effective contribution from star forming regions at high column densities.
% This could indeed be another [NEED TO CHANGE TEXT HERE] convincing evidence for dark gas, and in some extent we can use dust specific luminosity (or dust radiance) to trace the dark gas  in the ISM.

In the case the ``hump'' of \LH\ in  \av=(0.17$-$2.78) mag is due to ``dark gas'': 35 atomic sightlines (red points) contain \hi\ only with $<$\LH$>$$\approx$3.2$\times$10$^{-31}$WH$^{-1}$, as we assume \rad\ and \NH\ linear correlate (\LH\ = constant), this means every single H atom corresponds to an amount of $\sim$3.2$\times$10$^{-31}$W; \LH\ at the peak is $\sim$4.5$\times$10$^{-31}$W meaning that we need $\sim$1.4 H atoms or 40\% more H atoms. Since the ``hump'' is symmetry, the amount of ``dark gas'' is approximately 20\% of measured \hi\ in \av\ range (0.17$-$2.78) mag (CONSISTENT? REFs?  (Grenier et al 2005, Planck collab.
2011 XIX) ).

\cite{PLC2015} used $\gamma$ rays from Fermi LAT as the proxy for \NH\ to study the case of Chamaeleon clouds. They also notice a consistent decrease of \LH\ from 5$\times$10$^{-31}$ to 3$\times$10$^{-31}$WH$^{-1}$ in \NH\ range of (8$-$50)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$. It is clear that the maximum value of \LH\ in this case is slightly shifts to lower \NH. This is probably because they derived total \NH\ from $\gamma$ rays for specific molecular clouds while total \NH\ in PLC2014a is calculated from optically-thin \hi\ and CO data for the all-sky scale.

Since dust grains are in thermal equilibrium with the ambient interstellar radiation field, \rad\ is simply equal to the amount of energy absorbed (or emitted) by dust and it does not either depend on the shape of spectral energy distribution (SED) or the dust cooling efficiency. \sout{I would simplify the following sentence by saying that CIBA is a lesser contaminant in $R$ compared to $\tau_{353}$ and simply refer to the Planck paper.} In addition, \rad\ is less contaminated by the Cosmic Infrared Background Anisotropies (CIBA) compared to \t353 (PLC2014a). \sout{[JO NOTE/state: Probably need either more or less explanation here. i.e. Either define CIBA and explain more of the basics, or omit.]}, the 3 factors in equation \ref{eq_r_nh} dust-to-gas ratio $r$, absorption cross-section $\sigma_{a}$ and radiation field intensity $G_{0}$ do not widely vary. \LH\ fluctuates only in a narrow range ($\sim$2$-$3.5)$\times$10$^{-31}$WH$^{-1}$, thus dust radiance \rad\ is not scattered extensively away from the linear relationship with \NH\ as seen in Figure \ref{fig:r_vs_nh}. \sout{[JO EDIT: Suggest demonstrating this lack of scatter explicitly in a similar plot to Fig 6. Also, commenting on the significance - Radiance is a better proxy than tau? (Consistent with Planck 2014?)]} 

We have so far seen that along 35 atomic sightlines: \ebv\ and \rad\ have tight linear relations with \NH\ in the \av\ range 0.03$\sim$1.5 mag; \t353\ also has a linear relation with \NH\, but begins to deviate towards top end of this \av\ range. Unfortunately, we do not have opportunity to understand how these relations will change when approaching higher \av\, as well as regimes of molecular clouds. Yet we could be sure \t353\ is far from the linear relation with \NH.

As we discussed earlier, \t353\ is a parameter derived from a MBB fit. It is contaminated by the CIBA because it is the quotient of $I_{353}$ and the Planck function $B_{353}(T_{obs})$. \t353 is proportional to \NH\ only if \s353 is constant, but \s353 largely varies in low-to-moderate \NH\ due to the dependence of \t353 on dust emissivity cross-section $\kappa_{0}$. Meanwhile, dust radiance \rad\ seems to be a measurable quantity and it correlates with \NH\ in wider range. This suggests that radiance could be a better proxy for \NH\ than \t353 in low-to-moderate \NH\ range. Indeed, along all 94 sightlines considered in this work, the ratio between \NH\ obtained from \t353 and from radiance increases and reaches the factor of 4 as visual extinction \av\ rises fro 0.03 to 4.8 mag, whereas that ratio from \ebv\ does not seem to exceed the factor of 2 (see Figure \ref{fig:ratios_of_nh}).

\section{OH abundance ratio \xoh}
\label{sec:xoh}
The 2.6mm emission line of CO has been used to probe the physical properties of \h2 clouds, but in the regimes where CO is not detectable, other molecular/atomic transitions (e.g OH ground state main lines at 1665 and 1667MHz, CH ground state main line at 3335 MHz, ortho $1_{10}$-$1_{01}$ and para $2_{20}$-$2_{11}$ transitions of C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ at 18.3 and 21.6 GHz, $^3$P$_1$$\rightarrow$$^3$P$_0$ fine structure line of atomic carbon at 492 GHz, etc.) have been considered as potential alternative tracers of \h2. However, it is worth noting that \cite{Cotten2013} claimed CO(1-0) observations at higher sensitivity (greater than the 0.1-0.2 K rms) can trace molecular gas in regions where \av$\sim$0.3 mag. Among these alternatives, the ground-state main lines of OH are the easiest to observe; they are readily detectable in translucent/diffuse molecular clouds (\citealt{Magnani1990}, \citealt{Barriault2010}), OH is considered as a precursor molecule necessary to the formation of CO in diffuse regions (\citealt{Black1977}, \citealt{Barriault2010}), and thus it is expected to be abundant in low CO density/abundance regimes.

To estimate the \h2 column density from OH, we have to determine the OH abundance ratio with respect to \h2, \xoh= \NOH/\NHm. 

Many efforts (models or observations) have been devoted to derive \xoh\ in different environment conditions:

% - Models of translucent and diffuse molecular clouds with \av\ from 0.1 to 1 mag and $T_{K}$ from 50 to 100K by Viala (1986) found that the \xoh\ varied from 3.8$\times$10$^{-9}$ to 9.4$\times$10$^{-9}$. 

- Astrochemical model by \citet{Black1977} shows that \xoh$\sim$$10^{-7}$ for the case of $\zeta$ Ophuichi cloud.

- 19 comprehensive models of diffuse interstellar clouds with \nh\ from 250 to 1000 \cc, $T_{K}$ from 20 to 100K and \av\ from 0.62 to 2.12 mag \citet{vanDishoeck1986} found OH/\h2\ abundances from 1.6$\times$$10^{-8}$ to 2.9$\times$$10^{-7}$.

- OH abundance with respect to \h2\ from chemical models of hot diffuse cloud and moderate diffuse cloud (\citealt{Viala1986}) varies from 7.8$\times$$10^{-9}$ to 8.3$\times$$10^{-8}$ with \av=(0.1$-$1)mag, $T_{K}$=(50$-$100)K, $n$=(50-1000)\cc.

- 6 model calculations (that differ in depletion factors of heavy elements and cosmic ray ionization rate) by \citet{Nercessian1988} towards molecular cloud in front of star HD 29647 in Taurus show that OH/\h2\ ratio extend from 5.3$\times$$10^{-8}$ to 2.5$\times$$10^{-6}$. The best fit was obtained with \av=3.7 mag, \nh=800\cc and a uniform low temperature T=10K.

- From OH observations towards high-latitude clouds using 43m NRAO telescope, \citet{Magnani1988} derived \xoh\ from 4.8$\times$$10^{-7}$ to 4$\times$$10^{-6}$ in the range of \av=(0.4$-$1.1) mag (excitation temperatures of OH mainlines were assumed to be equal, T$_{ex(1665)}$=T$_{ex(1667)}$).

- Andersson \& Wannier (1993) obtained the OH abundance of $\sim$$10^{-7}$ from the model of halo around dark molecular clouds. Weselak et al. (2010) derived OH abundance of (1.05$\pm$0.24)$\times$$10^{-7}$ from OH absorption line observations of 5 translucent sightlines; these results are almost identical to the \xoh\ estimated by Liszt \& Lucas (2002).  

The past studies indicate that the OH abundance ratio in molecular regions varies in a wide range (4$\times$10$^{-9}$ to 1$\times$10$^{-6}$), in this paper we also determine our own OH abundance, we use observations from Arecibo telescope to provide \NOH\ and \NHI; then employ \t353, \rad, \ebv\ (along with our own conversion factors) as surrogates for $N_{H_{2}}$=$\frac{1}{2}(N_{H}{-}N_{HI})$. In this case, we examine only 17 specific sightlines where \NHm$>$0. We assume that the linear correlations (deduced from \t353, \rad, \ebv\ and \NHI\ towards 35 atomic sightlines) still hold in the regions of molecular clouds. In this manner, a direct estimates of the OH/\h2\ abundance ratio can be obtained from 3 different methods, thus allow us to intercompare/check the consistence among the derived OH abundances within a wide range of visual extinction \av\ (0.25$-$4.8 mag). \sout{\color{red}[JO NOTE: Say something about range of environmental conditions we are probing: from diffuse sightlines with no CO, to CO-rich molecular clouds. Or Av from ?? to ??]} Despite the potential for all calibration methods to deviate as moving into different physical regimes, we still find that OH/\h2\ abundance ratio is basically consistent for all methods, \xoh$\sim$10$^{-7}$. This is holding for sightlines with and without CO (e.g 3C132), as per Li et al. 2017 (in preparation).

% \sout{We see so far the strong linear correlations between \t353, $R$, $E(B-V)$ and $N_{H}$ despite of the fluctuation about the linear fit due to the evolution of dust grain properties. In this section, we will use \t353, $R$, $E(B-V)$ (along with our own conversion factors) as the proxies for the total gas columns $N_{H}$ to derive the OH abundance ratio, $X_{OH} = N_{OH}/N_{H_{2}}$ \textbf{[JO NOTE: Perhaps move this paragraph into the start of the next section?]}.}

\sout{JO NOTE: Say why it's important 
for which few literature measurements exist??.}

Nevertheless, there are differences in the 3 methods due to the overestimation of \NH\ derived from \t353 and \ebv\ compared to \NH\ from \rad\ (as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:ratios_of_nh}) along sightlines. The \xoh\ ratios from \t353 and \ebv\ are quite consistent and appear to be constants around 0.5$\times$10$^{-7}$, 1$\times$10$^{-7}$ respectively; whereas the \xoh\ deduced from \rad\ is higher and suggests a possible rapidly-increasing trend ($\sim$1 to 7$\times$10$^{-7}$) as \av\ rises from 0.25 to 2.8 mag. However, its uncertainties are huge, its mean value is \xoh$\sim$2.5$\times$10$^{-7}$. Three data points (3C123, 3C131, 3C133) with large uncertainties at \av=2.5 mag are in the Galactic plane, they seem to locate at the edges of dust clumps (as shown in Figure 16 and Figure 19 in Appendix).

Xu et al. 2016 found that across the boundary of Taurus molecular cloud the \xoh\ decreases from 8 to 1$\times$10$^{-7}$ as \av\ increases from 0.4 to 2.7 mag. This is somewhat opposite to the trend of our \xoh, we take all the gas clumps along sightlines into account, but they study a local molecular cloud and their overabundance of OH in outer cloud region may be driven by the shock wave. (DIFFERENCE. WHY????? The different environment? or the OH PRODUCTION caused by SHOCK WAVE: additional channel of OH production active, possibly due to the shock (e.g., Draine \& Katz 1986a) produced by the colliding streams. When shock waves propagate through the molecular ISM the ambient gas is compressed, heated, and accelerated.
When temperature is above 300 K, the neutral-neutral reactions become important, which yield the overabundance of OH).

- \sout{Show some cases where no CO but OH. the plot???}

- \sout{Since these results are obtained in a wide ranges of longitude $l$ and latitude $b$ with some sightlines through the Galactic plane, it suggests that OH main lines are excellent tracers of molecular gas in ISM??????}

\label{fig:hist_xoh}
\end{figure}

With the advantage that \NOH\ is estimated directly from On-/Off-source measurements, we also investigate the possible relation of \NOH\ and visual extinction \av\ to figure out how OH abundance varies from lower to higher density regions. These estimates of \NOH/\av\ ratios are presented in Table \ref{table:noh_vs_av}.

As show in Figure \ref{fig:noh_vs_av}, \NOH\ increases with the increasing \av, this means OH is more abundant in the regions where dust is denser. We do not find any evidences to believe that the ratio of \NOH/\av\ could be a constant over a large range of physical conditions, indeed, it varies from (1$-$16)$\times$10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$. However, it seems that \NOH/\av$\approx$4.6$\times$10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$; compared to \NOH/\av$\approx$8$\times$10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$ over the range \av=0.4$-$7 mag from Crutcher et al. 1979, this average value is smaller by the factor of $\sim$0.6. The differences may arise from the fact that they used 10 published results in which most of the estimates of \NOH\ involve assumptions on \Tex\ and/or Thermal Equilibrium of main lines.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The true \hi\ column densities along 94 sightlines obtained from Arecibo Millennium Survey and 21-SPONGE survey spread in a wide \sout{M.A:please quantify wide} range \NHI=(1$-$122)$\times10^{20}$cm$^{-2}$. When combining with thermal dust data from Planck collaboration and OH data also from Arecibo telescope, this gives us an excellent opportunity to reveal the possible presence of dark gas, to perceive the evolution of dust grains in different environment, as well as to estimate the OH/H$_{2}$ abundance ratio. We have the conclusions as follows:

1. Dust evolution from \s353.

2. Possible presence of Dark gas from \LH: $\sim$20\% of measured \hi\ in \av=(0.17$-$2.78) mag. \sout{M.A: can you quantify the fraction of $N_H$ in dark ?}

3. OH/\h2\ abundance ratios derived from 3 proxies for \NH\ (\t353, E(B-V) and \rad) are in general consistent, \xoh$\sim$10$^{-7}$.
